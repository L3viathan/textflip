# textflip

Rotate text by 180°, so you can sı̣ɥʇ ǝʞı̣ן ǝʇı̣ɹʍ.

## Installation

    pip install textflip

## Usage

    >>> from textflip import flip
    >>> flip("Testing textflip")
    'dı̣ןɟʇxǝʇ ɓuı̣ʇsǝ┴'

## Issues

Not every letter has a perfect flipped counterpart, so many letters just don't work or look slightly weird upside-down. Most western letters work somewhat fine, though.
